:warning: *Pushes to the project repository are not indicative of individual contributions. The project was fully developed using Pair Programming on a shared computer.* :warning:

As part of a programming project in our second year of Computer Science, we developed the C version of the Carcassonne board game. Each player starts the game with 6 meeples.

To compile and run the project on a Linux terminal:

1. Open a full-screen Linux terminal in the Carcassonne directory (make sure it uses UTF-8 encoding)
2. Use `make run` to compile and run the game
3. Adjust the zoom as needed

**Note :** Avoid placing meeples in the center when there is a coat of arms in the middle (due to display differences between terminals).
